            <h2>About Native Plants</h2>
            <p>Native plants play a vital role in Ohio’s ecosystems by supporting biodiversity.
                Native plants are adapted to the climate and soils, and require less fertilizer, water, and 
                pesticides than non-native species. Additionally, they provide essential food and habitat for 
                pollinators, birds, and other wildlife. They also help reduce erosion, filter stormwater,
                and store carbon. Beyond ecological benefits, native plants connect communities to Ohio’s 
                natural heritage and create landscapes that are both beautiful and sustainable. </p>
